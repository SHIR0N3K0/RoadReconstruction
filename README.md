The goal of that project was to try to reproduce but in my own way a mechanic i've seen in a lot of different games, wich is a road/bridge/stairs which are fragmented and 
when the player walk walk near their original location the parts return by themselves to give the player a path and when the player is no longer near the parts go back to
float around.

Work Time: 7h (Most of the time was used to understand how chaos work, and how to adapt it to my need since i never used it before)

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Import or create a mesh.
2. Place it in the level.
3. Open **Fracture Mode**.

4. Click on **New** while your **mesh is still selected** and save it wherever you want.

5. Now that you have your Geometry Collection(GC) you can choose the king of fracture you want, here either **Uniform** or **Cluster**.

6. You now need to get the parts as mesh, for that you need to select all the parts in the **Fracture Hierarchy Window**, then click on **ToMesh** and **Convert**, you
can now choose the destination folder. (You can delete all the part created on the map just keep the GC)

<br><img width="678" height="262" alt="Show_ConvertToMesh" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a2a36f9-105a-4f9f-9bbe-8478680b873f" />
7. Now That you have your meshes go to **/All/Plugins/Plugin_WalkingRebuilding/PluginBP** and Open the Data Table **"DT_Meshes"**
<br><img width="836" height="236" alt="Capture d&#39;écran 2026-03-27 110051" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cc7cfdb-7211-439e-aaf9-88c6c0819e42" />
8. After opening the Data table **click Add** after adding the new row **Select all mesh part** and drop them in the new Row **Chunk** Variable (Don't forget to
rename Row)
<br><img width="644" height="38" alt="Show_AddRow" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a96c50d7-c1ab-475c-a8c0-72b3443a7c8c" />
<br>![Show_AddPartsToRow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b958d961-348a-4740-a094-021ad5b6454f)
9. Now in **/All/Plugins/Plugin_WalkingRebuilding/PluginBP** take the **Bp_RoadChunckManager** and drop it on the map
10. After dropping it, go to it's **Detail** and in the **Default Section** select your GC (appear only if the GC is on the Map)
<br><img width="536" height="162" alt="Show_GCVariable" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2866de61-37c1-49c1-9b1e-2c0bc0edf374" />
<br><img width="564" height="490" alt="Show_GConMap" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97aea11e-5e15-406c-925e-16c5ea21b706" />
11. Now still in the **Default Section** of the **Bp_RoadChunckManager** you should have a Variable Named **Data Table Row** There you need to give the name
of the Row you added to the Data Table
<br><img width="325" height="27" alt="Capture d&#39;écran 2026-03-27 114141" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91c9054e-d9ef-43ac-ac95-0ec37d32b1e8" />

Result: You now have a mesh wich rebuilt itself as you Walk over it
